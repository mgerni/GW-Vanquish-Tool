# Guild Wars Vanquish Tool

**Check it out live:** [GitHub Pages Site](https://mgerni.github.io/GW-Vanquish-Tool/))

This is a web tool for tracking **foes and their skills** in Guild Wars, inspired by the original vanquish tool created by [n0xin_gw](https://www.reddit.com/r/GuildWars/comments/1r3umcd/comment/o5b0i5u/?context=1).  

The site allows you to:

- Select a **campaign and area**  
- View all **foes** in that area  
- Check each foe’s **skills and effects**  
- Click through to the **wiki pages** for reference

## Purpose

I am **open to feedback** or suggestions for changes the community would like to see.
